# About me

Hi, I'm Shanyu Thibaut, a BS student at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. I study Computer Science.

## Interests

- **Compilers:** disassembly, (de)optimization, decompilers
- **Obfuscation:** dynamic opaque predicates, SSA and virtualization
- **Law**: civil and ip law

## Projects

I'm responsible for the following projects
- [**Skidfuscator Java Obfuscator**](https://github.com/skidfuscatordev/skidfuscator-java-obfuscator): Full Java obfuscator with inter-procedural obfuscation, leveraging SSA form to create some of the most complex flow obfuscation found in java
- [**Artemis Anticheat**](https://github.com/artemisac/artemis-minecraft-anticheat): Java anticheating software toolset designed to emulate and replicate Minecraft's physics engine on the server-side based on incomplete data and heuristically bruteforced inferences

## Research
- Analysis, evaluation and proposal of an inter-procedural Java Obfuscation methodology (2023, publishing soon?)
